# Business-Negotiation-Club
In this repository is a compilation of notes that have been created during more than two years of teaching negotiation at the [United Nations Youth and Student Association of Austria - Academic Forum for Foreign Affairs](http://www.negotiations.at/).

These notes proved to be particularly beneficial for newcomers, although they will be useful to everyone who wants to become better and more effective in negotiations.

We hope that these notes help some of you to

- recognize the countless different negotiation situations we find ourselves in every day
- analyze your personal negotiation and conflict style
- understand the dynamics and complexities of the negotiation process
- communicate more reflected and less reflexive
- feel more confident and less intimidated, especially when it comes to negotiate on your own behalf
- create mutually satisfying outcomes with the people you encounter,

and most of all, that you enjoy browsing through this repository.
