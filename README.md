# Business-Negotiation-Club
In this repository we have collected a compilation of our notes that have been created in over more than two years of teaching negotiation at the [United Nations Youth and Student Association of Austria - Academic Forum for Foreign Affaires](http://www.negotiations.at/).

These notes are for everyone who wants to become better and more effective in negotiations. 

We hope that these notes help some of you to

- recognize the the countless different negotiation situations we find ourselves in every day
- understand the underlying process that guides our negotiations
- feel more confident and less intimidated, especially when it comes to negotiate on your own behalf
- create mutually satisfying outcomes with the people you encounter,

and most of all, that you enjoy browsing through this repository.
